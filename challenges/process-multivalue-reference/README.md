# Process Multivalue References

In hierarchical documents, it is currently not completely clear how to process multivalue references.

## Extensions

- What if you want to parse a data element and this results in multiple values? see `input-1, tags`?
- What if you want to generate an RDF:List from a multiple result? see `output, ex:hasAuthors`.
- What if you want create additional resources based on a (processed) reference that restuls in multiple values?

## Discussions

- This is very related to 'multivalue-references', e.g., being able to create an rdf:List: is this part of this challenge, or part of 'multivalue-references'?

## Conclusions
