# Language Map

The possibility to create a literal with a language,
where the language tag is derived from source data.

## Extensions

- What if we want to derive, e.g., 'fr' from 'French'?
  - related to data transformations
- What if the language tag is in another data source?
  - related to joins, see <https://github.com/kg-construct/mapping-challenges/issues/23>

## Conclusions

The language of a term SHOULD also be generated, similar to how values of terms are generated: constant, template, w/data transformation, joining from other data
